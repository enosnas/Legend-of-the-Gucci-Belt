This project, currently unnamed and can be referenced as Project M, is currently in development and has been since June 13, 2024.

The Legend of the Gucci Belt was a high school game design project that I created for my final. It was a very simple platformer and during COVID it gained some attention from my friends
as I began to update it and try to improve things using my knowledge of coding from college. Now, as a business analytics master's student I have begun coding in Python much more and 
thought it would be good to practice coding in general as well as pursue a passion project as I loved developing games in high school! While it began as a sequel project with a simple
plan of enhanced graphics and physics, this project has now grown into a whole new being as I have continued to find cool and entertaining mechanics and ideas to add! I'm looking forward
to the continued development and eventual release of this project, maybe it can even be as big as Blobert, my biggest inspiration!

7/17 Update
I'll put in more updates as they come but right now the main focus is completing the main mechanics of the game!
Right now I would estimate that I am around 60% complete with the main mechanics. This comes after a sudden realization that Gucci Belt can be so much more, 
and might not even be Gucci Belt soon! I don't want to spoil too much but look forward to some new mechanics such as wall jumping/sliding, destroying terrain, and more!

8/19 Update
I have finished the core mechanics of the game after lots of bug fixing and issues that were resolved after a bit of time and research! I'm now working on the level designs, 
improved animations and character designs, as well as the story of this new game. 

9/17 Update
I have been creating hand drawn art for the game including player sprites for animations, items, and soon the levels. This has taken quite a long time as I am inexperienced with art and design
but I am making better progress the more I try haha. I also haven't been making many new commits as school has started again and I am focusing more time on studies, but I will make sure to 
continue working hard on the art and design so that the game can look good and feel fun to play! Right now the main goal is to have the player animations fully finished, enemy sprites created, and 
to either find level art or make my own (hopefully I can find some good art as making entire level art seems daunting as of now!), and hopefully I can have this done by the end of October!
