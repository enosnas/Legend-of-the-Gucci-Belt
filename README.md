This project is currently in development and has been since June 13, 2024.

The Legend of the Gucci Belt was a high school game design project that I created for my final. It was a very simple platformer and during COVID it gained some attention from my friends
as I began to update it and try to improve things using my knowledge of coding from college. Now, as a business analytics master's student I have begun coding in Python much more and 
thought it would be good to practice coding in general as well as pursue a passion project as I loved developing games in high school! While it began as a sequel project with a simple
plan of enhanced graphics and physics, this project has now grown into a whole new being as I have continued to find cool and entertaining mechanics and ideas to add! I'm looking forward
to the continued development and eventual release of this project, maybe it can even be as big as Blobert, my biggest inspiration!

7/17 Update
I'll put in more updates as they come but right now the main focus is completing the main mechanics of the game!
Right now I would estimate that I am around 60% complete with the main mechanics. This comes after a sudden realization that Gucci Belt can be so much more, 
and might not even be Gucci Belt soon! I don't want to spoil too much but look forward to some new mechanics such as wall jumping/sliding, destroying terrain, and more!
